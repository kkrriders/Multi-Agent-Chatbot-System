# Flexible Multi-Agent Work System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Overview
The Flexible Multi-Agent Work System allows you to define custom roles and prompts for each agent, enabling them to work together on ANY type of task - from coding to research to creative work.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **User Defines Agent Roles**
- Set custom names for each agent (e.g., "Frontend Developer", "Market Analyst")
- Write detailed custom prompts defining their expertise and behavior
- Choose which agents to include in your team (1-4 agents)

### 2. **Agents Work According to Custom Prompts**
- Each agent receives your custom prompt as their role definition
- Agents work sequentially, building on each other's contributions
- Real-time updates show agents working live

### 3. **Manager Provides Final Enhancement**
- Manager reviews all agent contributions
- Provides synthesis, enhancement, and conclusions
- Ends the conversation with strategic guidance
